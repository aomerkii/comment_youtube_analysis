neutral,"Liked it but you could've done much better like adding some scenes from Aquaman or the meg.Also,according to Jim Cameron the live action or principle photography of Avatar 2 is 100% complete and only post production is left.Not only that but live action parts of Avatar 3 is almost 95% complete and they'll start remaining work as immediately after Avatar 2 is released."

I'm going to have a baby''."

positive,"Only king kong 2005 and avatar can conpete with visuals in todays movies. I mean these movies were beautifull, and on the side note, these are the only movies that were so good that there was no need to look at my phone or skip like i do ussualy in other movies and these kind of movies make me want not just a sequel but to live my whole life in them. Not sequel, not tv show, whole life. Now thats a good movie if you ask me. I watched both avatar and king kong so many times but i never skip one second of them or look away from the screen while watching them."
